## Initial Project

### Init Angular project

```bash
ng new angular-starter-kit --standalone=true --style=scss --skip-git=true --skip-tests=true
```

```bash
npm i -D webpack-bundle-analyzer
```

### Angular Material

```bash
ng add @angular/material
```

### Angular PWA

```bash
ng add @angular/pwa
```

### Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS. Install **@tailwindcss/postcss** and its peer dependencies via npm.

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss --force
```

Configure PostCSS Plugins. Create a **.postcssrc.json** file in the root of your project and add the **@tailwindcss/postcss** plugin to your PostCSS configuration.

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {}
  }
}
```

Import Tailwind CSS. Add an **@use** to **./src/styles.scss** that imports Tailwind CSS.

```scss
@import "tailwindcss";
```

```bash
npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
```

```
// .prettierrc
{
  ...
  "plugins": ["prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"]
}
```

### Transloco

```bash
ng add @jsverse/transloco
```

### Playwright

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

### Vitest

```bash
npm i -D vitest @vitest/coverage-istanbul @vitest/coverage-v8 @vitest/ui
```

### Prettier

```bash
npm i -D prettier
```

### Libraries

```bash
npm i lodash luxon @ngrx/store animate.css ngx-skeleton-loader ngx-toastr uuid nanoid zod hotkeys-js swiper apexcharts ng-apexcharts

```bash
npm i -D @types/lodash @types/luxon @types/uuid @types/nanoid
```

## Coding Naming Conventions

âž– PascalCase ðŸ‘‰ Classes and Methods

âž– camelCase ðŸ‘‰ variable and function names

âž– snake_case ðŸ‘‰ file names and variable identifiers

âž– kebab-case ðŸ‘‰ HTML attributes and CSS classes

âž– UPPERCASE ðŸ‘‰ CONSTANTS and ENUMERATIONS

âž– UPPER_SNAKE_CASE ðŸ‘‰ CONSTANTS and ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES

## Git Branch Naming Convention

### Code Flow Branches

âž– Development (dev)

All new features and bug fixes should be brought to the development branch.

âž– QA/Test (test)

Contains all codes ready for QA testing.

âž– Staging (staging, Optional)

It contains tested features that the stakeholders wanted to be available either for a demo or a proposal before elevating into production.

âž– Master (master)

The production branch, if the repository is published, is the default branch being presented.

### Temporary Branches

#### âž– Feature

Any code changes for a new module or use case should be done on a feature branch. This branch is created based on the current development branch. When all changes are Done, a Pull Request/Merge Request is needed to put all of these to the development branch.

Examples

feature/AZURE-1234

feature/AZURE-5678

#### âž– Bug Fix

If the code changes made from the feature branch were rejected after a release, sprint or demo, any necessary fixes after that should be done on the bugfix branch.

Examples

bugfix/AZURE-1234

bugfix/AZURE-5678

#### âž– Hot Fix

If there is a need to fix a blocker, do a temporary patch, or apply a critical framework or configuration change that should be handled immediately, it should be created as a Hotfix. It does not follow the scheduled integration of code and could be merged directly to the production branch and then into the development branch later.

Examples

hotfix/disable-endpoint-zero-day-exploit

hotfix/increase-scaling-threshold

#### âž– Experimental

Any new feature or idea that is not part of a release or a sprint. A branch for playing around.

Examples

experimental/dark-theme-support

#### âž– Build

A branch specifically for creating specific build artifacts or for doing code coverage runs.

Examples

build/azure-metric

#### âž– Release

A branch for tagging a specific release version.

Examples

release/app-1.0.0

#### âž– Merging

A temporary branch for resolving merge conflicts, usually between the latest development and a feature or Hotfix branch. This can also be used if two branches of a feature being worked on by multiple developers need to be merged, verified, and finalized.

Examples

merge/dev_lombok-refactoring

merge/combined-device-support
